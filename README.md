##Sporcle clone

###Sporcle: Description

Sporcle lets users create quizzes (trivia) which can be played by other users (or guests) on the site. Quizzes are typically timed, and require the user to “fill-in the blanks.” For example, a prompt may be: Words that rhyme with cat, followed by a text input box. 

Acceptable answers (as defined by quiz author) are instantaneously accepted and revealed; no pressing of ENTER or SUBMIT required. Textbox clears itself only on correct answers.
     Ex.: Can you name the one syllable words that rhyme with the word cat?

Users can also upload images for more visual guessing games.
     Ex.: Can you name the famous celebrity and character faces but badly drawn in Photoshop?

###Sporcle: Quiz creation
     
Only users may create quizzes. Quizzes are moderated, and may be published to top lists/front page. Users can rate quizzes, comment on them, favorite them, share them, and challenge other users on a quiz (multiplayer).

Quizzes must have title, description, category, timing assigned. Number of answers to guess (quiz length) and acceptable spellings of each answer must be provided. 

For example, in a game of Name all fast food franchises, author may allow: McDonald’s, mcdonalds, MacDonalds, Mc Donalds, etc -- as one answer.

Optional: tags, data source (credit for info used), images, answer/hint headings (ex.: name; in years), gameplay options (ex.: enforce answer order, allow incorrect answers).
